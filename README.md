# modemmonitoring
The purpose of these scripts is to monitoring the 3g modem for gammu failures. This reads gammu events and then uses minicom to reset the modem. Honestly I think gammu isnt speaking to the modem correctly but these scripts work and ive set it up as a service. I have the modem connect to a RPI with raspbian installed. I hope some people find this useful.
